# Spicy Handholding 
(WIP) A Hololive-themed incremental game that I made to practice Javascript/HTML/CSS. The game is playable as is but game balance and progression may be off since I just plugged in arbitrary numbers while trying to make sure features worked.

- Recruit streamers and gather fans to earn money and upgrade your studio!
- Make fans 'hold hands' to create fans with better stats!
- Create hybrid fans by mixing two fanbases together!
- Dark mode!

Can you create the ultimate fan?

# To Do
- Replace placeholder art with better ones.
